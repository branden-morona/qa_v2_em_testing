Are these tests stable/will they give us false positives?
These tests can seem to pass, but not do what we expect them to do. For example, I had a tough time getting a screenshot,
even though the test passed.

Do these tests miss bugs you could find manually following the same processes?
Though I do not believe it will miss bugs in what it is currently testing, I belive little mistakes can bring it there. 
Manual testing will ultimately take longe to execute, but leaves less room for error or missed coverage.

What would you change about the testing if you were given enough time?
I would abstract the "add employee" function to another class to clean up the code and not have to write a test for each of the
individual parts to each employee card.
